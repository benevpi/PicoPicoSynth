# PicoPicoSynth
Some basic sound synthesis on the Pico 

A bunch of tools for synthesizing sound on Pico. Take a look at example_synth for details. You can sequence, mix and generally poke sound about.

It's currently setup to use the Pimoroni Audio Pack, but you should be able to tweak it to use PWM if you want.
